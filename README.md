## Description
Navigate through vibrant platformer levels, collecting stars to unlock your instrument. 

Master the art of double jumping by collecting musical notes in mid-air, and overcome challenging obstacles with style. 

Can you hit the right notes and reunite with your guitar? Play One Way now and find out!

## Rules
Your objective is to get to the guitar, after obtaining all stars!

### Controls
​Movement: WASD or Left Stick
​Jump: Spacebar or X
Attack: F or Square

## Patterns Used
### FSM
I used an FSM pattern to make the player's movement.

### Object Pool
I Created an Object pool to manage the Notes creation, so it does not instantiate new notes on every stage.

### Factory
I used the Factory pattern to create notes with a specific configuration.

### Singleton
I used the Singleton pattern to manage Audio, Events and Pools.
